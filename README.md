## 📖 What is the Pomodoro Technique?  
The **Pomodoro Technique** was created by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.  
The name comes from a **tomato-shaped kitchen timer (*pomodoro* in Italian)** he used to manage his study time.  

The method works in cycles:  
- **25 minutes of focused work**  
- **5 minutes of short break**  
- After 4 cycles → **long break (15–30 minutes)**  

This routine helps improve concentration, reduces mental fatigue, and boosts consistency.
